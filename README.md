Hello World!

My name is Jamal Alleyne-Rogers. I was born in Brooklyn, New York, however, my parents are Caribbean. My dad is from St. Vincent and my mom is from Barbados.
I love to eat, play video games, listen to music, drive and write my future video game. 
Fun facts about me? My favorite colors are blue, green and purple. I love cars a whole lot; I actually still collect Matchboxes, Hotwheels, Maisto brand and other tiny to large scale toy or diecast model cars. My favorite planet is Saturn.
